    abstract = { A dynamical system derived from a conceptual climate model is investigated. The model is often referred to as the Budyko--Sellers-type energy balance model (EBM), or in short, the Budyko model. The focus of this study is on a mathematical formulation that further develops the model by capturing the ice line dynamics and thereby places the Budyko model within the dynamical systems framework. The classical Budyko EBM is represented here as an integro-difference equation, then coupled with an ice line equation. The resulting infinite dimensional system is shown to possess an attracting one dimensional invariant manifold. The novel formulation captures solutions that others have previously obtained while also making the formulation and the analysis of the model more precise. }
